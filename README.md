# CaesarCipher Application
This application was made to accomodate my activities in the [Engineer The Future](https://engineerthefuture.dk/) initiative, where "experts" of different engineering backgrounds
visit schools to talk about interesting subjects related to their field. Personally, I put together a visit where I talk about cryptography to illustrate how encryption and decryption works.

This application is show-cased in this visit to show that the things happening in software is not "magic", but rather a set of instructions running specific algorithms.
